\section{Importing IMDb dump}

\subsection{Changes made to our schema}
The following changes were made with the pgAdmin GUI DBMS.

\begin{itemize}
\item Added DeathDate to Person.
\item Merged firstname and lastname into name for Person.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps into importing dump}
Firstly we imported the dump into a mysql database.
We then found a python program for migrating a mysql database to a postgresql database.
Finally we made a python program for loading the IMDb dump data, and insert into a database with our own schema.
