We wish to minimize the average completion time of the tasks, defined as:
$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i$$
As $\frac{1}{n}$ is a constant, the problem is equivalent to minimizing:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i$$

To do this we simply sort the tasks by their processing time $p_i$, in ascending order.
Below we prove that this ordering minimizes the average completion time.

\paragraph{Proof}
Let $A$ be a list of tasks ordered as above.
We will then show that swapping two tasks will result in a larger average running time.

Let $a_j$ and $a_k$, where $j < k$ be two distinct tasks in $A$.
Note that we have that $p_j \leq p_k$ due to the ordering of tasks.

We now determine the completion time $c_i$ of the tasks.


$c_j=p_1+p_2+\dots+p_{j-1}+p_j + p_{j+1} + p_{j+2} + \dots + p_n$\\
$c_{j}=p_1+p_2+\dots+p_{j-1}+p_j + p_{j+1} + p_{j+2} + \dots + p_n$\\

Bruteforce algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
GETMAX(v,t)
\\
\If{v=t}{return 0}
\For{each(e in v.E)}{d = GETMAX(e.end, t) + e.w \\ \If{d $\ge$ dist}{dist = d}}
return dist
\end{algorithm}
The complexity for this algorithm is $e^e$.
