\section*{CLRS 33-2}
\paragraph{a.}We consider the leftmost point in layer $i$ and layer $i+1$.
The points are denoted as $p_i = (x_i, y_i)$ and $p_{i +1} = (x_{i +1}, y_{i +1})$ respectively.
We wish to show that $y_i > y_{i +1}$.
We do so by showing that $y_i \leq y_{i +1}$ cannot be true.

We split into two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assume} that $x_i > x_{i+1}$.
\\This assumption means that $p_{i+1}$ is not dominated by $p_i$.
But as $p_i$ is the leftmost point in layer $i$, this would mean that $p_{i+1}$ is part of layer $i$.
Thus we have a contradiction and $x_i > x_{i+1}$ cannot be true for $y_i \leq y_{i+1}$.
\item \textbf{Assume} that $x_i \leq x_{i+1}$.
\\This assumption means that $p_i$ is dominated by $p_{i+1}$.
This gives a direct contradiction as $p_{i+1}$ dominates $p_i$.
This $x_i \leq x_{i+1}$ cannot be true for $y_i \leq y_{i+1}$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{b.}We divide into the two cases described by the exercise:
\begin{itemize}
\item $j \leq k$: We have that $y_j < y$, thus the new point cannot be part of layers $L_{j+1}, L_{j+2} \dots L_k$ as per the the proof above.
Since $j$ is the minimum index such that $y_j < y$ it must also be true that the new point cannot be part of layers $L_{j-1}, L_{j-2} \dots L_1$.
Thus the point must be part of layer $L_j$.
\item $j = k + 1$: We have that $y < y_k$, thus the new point cannot be part of layers $L_1, L_2 \dots L_k$ as per the proof above.
Therefore it must be placed in a new layer.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{c.}
$M$ is a linkedlist containing each layer, where each layer has a property $leftmost$ which gets the leftmost point in that layer.
The AddFirst method adds a layer as the first layer in the linked list so the ordering is kept


\begin{algorithm}[H]
MAX\_LAYER($Q$) \\
$S$ is a sorted stack containing all points from $Q$, with largest $x$ on top \\
$M = \{ \}$ \\
\While{$S$ is not empty}
{
	r $\leftarrow$ s.pop() \\
	\ForEach{$m$ in $M$}
	{
		\If{r.y $>$ m.leftmost.y}
		{
			k.add(r) \\
			break
		}
	}
	m.addFirst($\{r\}$)
}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{d.}

The sorting in needs to be on x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate.

The condition $ y_j < y, \ unless \ y < y_k $ (mentioned in task b) needs to be changed to $ y_j < y, \ unless \ y \leq y_k $
