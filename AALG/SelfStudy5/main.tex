\section*{CLRS 33-2}
\paragraph{a.}We consider the leftmost point in layer $i$ and layer $i+1$.
The points are denoted as $p_i = (x_i, y_i)$ and $p_{i +1} = (x_{i +1}, y_{i +1})$ respectively.
We wish to show that $y_i > y_{i +1}$.
We do so by showing that $y_i \leq y_{i +1}$ cannot be true.

We split into two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assume} that $x_i > x_{i+1}$.
\\This assumption means that $p_{i+1}$ is not dominated by $p_i$.
But as $p_i$ is the leftmost point in layer $i$, this would mean that $p_{i+1}$ is part of layer $i$.
Thus we have a contradiction and $x_i > x_{i+1}$ cannot be true for $y_i \leq y_{i+1}$.
\item \textbf{Assume} that $x_i \leq x_{i+1}$.
\\This assumption means that $p_i$ is dominated by $p_{i+1}$.
This gives a direct contradiction as $p_{i+1}$ dominates $p_i$.
This $x_i \leq x_{i+1}$ cannot be true for $y_i \leq y_{i+1}$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{b.}We divide into the two cases described by the exercise:
\begin{itemize}
\item $j \leq k$: We have that $y_j < y$, thus the new point cannot be part of layer $L_{j+1} \dots L_k$
\item $j = k + 1$
\end{itemize}
